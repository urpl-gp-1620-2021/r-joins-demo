## Joining two tables together

Joins are powerful functions that allow you to connect two datasets together through matching values. They can be useful with spatial and non-spatial data alike.

As a recap of how joins work, we're going to show a simple example of two different kinds of joins: 'left' joins and 'inner' joins. For this example, we will be using the `band_members` and `band_instruments` dataframes, which are simple, 3-row datasets that comes included in the dplyr package.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
band_members # Example dataset of band member names and affiliations
```

```{r}
band_instruments # Example dataset of band member names and the instruments they play
```

As you would expect, the first two arguments in a join function are the two tables you are trying to connect together. The third argument is the "join field", which is the matching column in both datasets we will use to pair up rows. 

### Left Joins

A `left_join` keeps all of the rows in the first table you specify, appending data from the second table through matching values in the specified "join field". Let's see how this kind of join looks with our example data: 

```{r}
band_members_and_instruments <- 
  left_join(band_members, band_instruments, by = "name")

# When the "join field" column names don't match, you can use:
# by = c("column1" = "column2")

band_members_and_instruments
```

### Inner Joins

An `inner_join` keeps only the rows that have matching values between both tables in the specified "join field." Any other rows are discarded. Let's see how this kind of join looks with our example data: 

```{r}
band_members_with_instruments_only <- 
  inner_join(band_members, band_instruments, by = "name")

band_members_with_instruments_only
```

## Troubleshooting joins 

### Joining when matching columns have different names 

Often times, the "join field" in your first table has a different name than that of your second table. For example, you may be trying to join two tables on a common zip code, but the first table calls the column 'Zip' and the second table calls it 'Postal Code'. There's a special syntax here to make it work:

```{r}

# Let's change the "name" column to be called "MusicalArtist"
band_instruments_renamed <- band_instruments %>% rename(MusicalArtist = name)

# In our join function, we need to specify that the "name" column in the first table matches up with the "MusicalArtist" column in the second table. We do that by setting our "by" parameter differently:
band_members_and_instruments_2 <- 
  inner_join(band_members, band_instruments_renamed, 
             by = c("name" = "MusicalArtist"))

band_members_and_instruments_2
```


### Detecting duplicate values

Duplicate values in your data can cause problems with joins. For example, what if our `band_instruments` dataset listed "John" twice: 

```{r}

# Let's add a new row to band_instruments... say "John" also plays "flute"
band_instruments_with_dup <- band_instruments %>% add_row(name = "John", plays = "flute")

band_instruments_with_dup
```

When we try and join our `band_members` table with this new table, we now get 4 rows in the resulting table, even though our first table only had 3 rows... how can that be? 

```{r}

band_members_and_instruments_dup <- 
  left_join(band_members, band_instruments_with_dup, by = "name")

band_members_and_instruments_dup

```
In R, if there are multiple matches between the two tables, all combinations of the matches are returned. This GIF actually illustrates visually how this works:

To avoid confusing and unexpected results like this, it's important to always be checking for duplciate values in your data, _especially_ in columns that you intend to use as a join field. 

Luckily, the `janitor` package has a function for that called `get_dupes`.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
# Remember to run `install.packages('janitor')` in your console if you've
# never installed this package before.
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
band_instruments_with_dup %>% get_dupes(name)
```

Sometimes you may expect duplicate values in a column, and sometimes they may come as a surprise. General Rule: always know what each row represents in your data and what it should be unique by.


## Pro tip: clean column names using janitor package

Often times, the column names in your raw data are all over the place—with random capitalizations and spaces—making your data annoying to work with. 

Use the `clean_names` function from `janitor` package to standardize your column names right after importing your data. It'll make your life so much easier

See this quick example using the [NYCHA Facilities dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/NYCHA-Facilities-and-Service-Centers/d4iy-9uh7) from NYC Open Data.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Remember to run `install.packages('janitor')` in your console if you've
# never installed this package before.
library(janitor)

nycha_original_column_names <- read_csv('NYCHA_Facilities_and_Service_Centers.csv')

glimpse(nycha_original_column_names)
```

If we run the `clean_names` function after reading in our CSV, we start with wayyyy nicer column names:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nycha_clean_column_names <- read_csv('NYCHA_Facilities_and_Service_Centers.csv') %>% clean_names()

glimpse(nycha_clean_column_names)
```
